              Hackangelslabs was established long ago by Morton caples (pen name). After working for a major recovery and specialist agent in diffrents fields like crypto, binary options and private investigation company, Morton decided that it is no longer in alignment to his beliefs and values knowing how the entire scam process works. Now, Hackangelslabs is working hard to provide services to all those who got scammed around the world.
            </p>
            <p class="about_desc">
              That has forced us to protect ourselves in every way possible. Including the use of pen names and not exposing our location. we have become targets for binary options companies and more online scams that really don’t like what we do and Hackangelslabs accepts this as part of our occupational risk in the effort to recover people funds and resolves infidelity issues.
            </p>
            <p class="about_desc">

You can be rest assured that all of this is for the benefit of our clients and to be able to continue providing the services the best way possible. We wrote the word TRV(TRACK-RECOVER-VALIDATE) on our flag and we are 100% dedicated to each customer case.

                      I lost a lot of money through a binary option scam. I first tried to get my money back through charge back with the banks, but the fraudsters had all the answers to the banks and my disputes were closed. I then contacted a trade lawyer, who took the company to court and won my case and I was awarded a massive amount in damages, but the lawyer also turned out to be a fraudster and I lost more money. I had lost hope and prepared myself to write off my losses, but decided to try hackangelslab as a last resort, because I simply had no more funds to pay lawyer retainer fees.

                      January 2021 was for me the beginning of a nightmare that ended recently thanks to hackangelslab.com and Morton. I lost 100,000 USD with a crypto scam whom I taught were professional investors. With the help of Morton, I was able to recover some money so that I can now put that horrible story behind. Megan was very compassionate and understanding. She was always available; it was easy to get in touch with her. I cannot imagine what would have been my life within the last six months without her support. I urge everyone; don’t ever get involved with crypto companies that has not been validated by hacksangelslab.com.

                      hackangelslab.com provided me with excellent service, to receive most of my funds back. I had made a large investment with a binary option company and over a period of time had tripled this investment. It turned out to all be fictitious and then had the horrible realization that I had probably lost everything. I knew I had limited time to maybe recover a little of my original investment. Megan was especially helpful. Through her guidance over a difficult 4 months I was able to recover 95%. It required solid teamwork and persistence.

                      Morton was really great especially because she is an Aussie it made me a little more comfortable at the start. As she began to dissect and work through evidence it felt good to have someone on my side. he is such a lovely and easy to person to talk with such a professional determined approach to getting solving my infedelity issue. If he has done it over and over again then morton at hackangelslab.com will do the upmost best to track your infidelity partner.

                      morton was extremely supportive throughout the ordeal of trying to track my cheating wife after all i got for her. Ultimately he succeeded in getting all the conversation and pictures of her and the flirty ones and  the money that I had lost to her. His professionalism and his considerable experience enabled me to achieve a successful outcome for me. I recommend both hackangelslab and morton.

                  Not with any brokerage firm I am familiar with, and I know quite a few.
You may be able to make money by yourself, but it is my experience that if you take the guidance of the brokers you will lose in the end. The loss rate is 96%.
